This conversion needs a recent pandoc release.  I solved the problem by building pandoc in spack as below.  I then added a link in $HOME/bin to pandoc so it is found whenever running convert.pl

Building pandoc:
  git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
  cd spack
  git co releases/v0.17
  cd bin
  ./spack instal pandoc
  this is pandoc 2.14.0

  These steps are for using pandoc from spack
  source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  spack find pandoc
  spack load pandoc

  But I added a symlink
  cd $HOME/bin
  ln -s /scratch/garren/spack/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-haswell/gcc-4.8.5/pandoc-2.14.0.3-ywxpn5lrrcjjl7uij4ycnuaowabpfnue/bin/pandoc

The actual conversion is controlled by doit.sh.
Note that running the script requires a password for your github ssh token and the FNAL services password.
  From some working directory in scratch
  .../laradmin/gitwiki/doit.sh <new_dir>

Issues noted:
  Tables must have the same number of columns in all rows.
  If they do not, pandoc will not create a markdown table.

  Pandoc does not seem able to deal with collapsed pointers.  Just get rid of them.
  This only affected two LArSoft wiki pages.

  Most email references are removed by scripting, but a few of the less common constructs were
  simply removed by editing the redmine wiki pages.

There is a problem with one or more of the the wiki/*.md pages.  
Working procedure.  Remove all wiki/*.md and add them back a few at a time.
