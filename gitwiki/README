This conversion needs a recent pandoc release.  I solved the problem by building pandoc in spack as below.  I then added a link in $HOME/bin to pandoc so it is found whenever running convert.pl

Building pandoc:
  git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
  cd spack
  git co releases/v0.17
  cd bin
  ./spack instal pandoc
  this is pandoc 2.14.0

  These steps are for using pandoc from spack
  source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  spack find pandoc
  spack load pandoc

  But I added a symlink
  cd $HOME/bin
  ln -s /scratch/garren/spack/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-haswell/gcc-4.8.5/pandoc-2.14.0.3-ywxpn5lrrcjjl7uij4ycnuaowabpfnue/bin/pandoc

The actual conversion is controlled by doit.sh.
Note that running the script requires a password for your github ssh token and the FNAL services password.
  From some working directory in scratch
  .../laradmin/gitwiki/doit.sh <new_dir>

There is a problem with one or more of the the wiki/*.md pages.  
Working procedure.  Remove all wiki/*.md and add them back a few at a time.
