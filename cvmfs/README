At this time oasis-sync needs to be run as yourself, not as user larsoft.

Before running oasis-sync, you need to initialize your grid credentials.

voms-proxy-init -voms fermilab

This step must be interactive because you need to supply a password.
Somewhere around June 2014 we hope that infrastructure will be in place so that
this can be automated and run by larsoft instead of individual users.

Once you have completed the init step:

/grid/fermiapp/larsoft/home/larsoft/code/laradmin/cvmfs/oasis-sync larsoft

oasis-sync options:
  -n: use the rsync dry-run option (implies -r)
  -v: use the rsync verbose option
  -r: do only rsync step
  -p: do only publish step
