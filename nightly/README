Scripts for the build are in the laradmin git repository. 
They are checked out at
    /grid/fermiapp/larsoft/home/larsoft/code/laradmin/nightly

All the nightly scripts source config_nightly.sh to set variables used
by the scripts.

For development testing of the nightly scripts, add a "-d" option to
any of them before the project name.  This will avoid writing to
anything that's in production.  (The -d option isn't supported or
needed if you directly invoke nightly_build.sh.)

To initialize: run "init_nightly.sh <project>" where <project> is "larsoft",
"uboone", or "lbne".  This will initialize ../../<project>_nightly_build
relative to the location of where the nightly scripts are checked out.

To run a nightly build: run "nightly.sh <project>".  This calls
tag_nightly.sh to check out and tag the source, build_nightly.sh once
for each build type, and copy_nightly.sh at the end to install into
the final products area.

There will be 4 builds:
slf5 debug
slf5 prof
slf6 debug
slf6 prof

Each script has its own completion file in <project>_nightly_build/stamps.
Logs go into <project>_nightly_build/logs.  Old stamps & logs, and tags
from the git repository, should be cleaned out from cron occasionally
with "cleanold_nightly.sh <project>".
