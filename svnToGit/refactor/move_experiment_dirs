#
# Details:
# --------
# The process of extracting files from svn and putting them into 
# the lbnecode and uboonecode repositories leaves the files at 
# a spot too high in the directory hierarchy. (Include file directives
# cannot distinguish the two locations, e.g., #include "Geometry/Geometry.h"
# could refer either to larcore/Geometry/Geometry.h or
# uboonecode/Geometry/Geometry.h) Consequently, we need to move files from
# the top-level directories in each repository into a sub-directory
# that is experiment specific (so that in the example above, we would
# have #include "uboone/Geometry/Geometry.h" for the one in uboonecode.
#
# Starting from a directory with lbnecode and uboonecode repositories present,
# this script loops over the known sub-directories in a freshly migrated
# uboonecode and lbnecode and moves them into a "uboone" or "lbne" 
# sub-directory, respectively. It does this using the "git filter-branch"
# command so that all history information is (seamlessly) retained.
#
# Prerequisites:
# o  lbnecode and uboonecode in the current working directory
# o  the 'laradmin' repository is in the current working directory
# o  git is set up
