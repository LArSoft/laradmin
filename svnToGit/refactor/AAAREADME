# AAAREADME

Instructions for running the re-factoring procedure.
Prerequisites:
o  A set of git repositories made from the LArSoft svn2git procedure
o  A working directory created by 'mrb newDev'
o  The standard LArSoft setup procedure has been executed

0) Initial steps:  create working area from last beta release

   . /grid/fermiapp/products/larsoft/setup
   setup git
   setup gitflow
   setup mrb
   export MRB_PROJECT=larsoft
   
   mkdir <work directory>
   cd <work directory>
   mrb newDev -v v0_02_02 -q e4:debug
   
   . localProducts_larsoft_v0_02_02_e4_debug/setup
   cd srcs
   
   git clone ssh://p-laradmin@cdcvs.fnal.gov/cvs/projects/laradmin
   
   
The following scripts are in laradmin/svnToGit/refactor:

1) Run prepare_source_area
2) Run populate_uboonecode and populate_lbnecode
   NOTE:  make sure that UBOONE_DATATYPES_SOURCE in populate_uboonecode points to
   a raw uboonecode from the svn2git procedure. This is the only source for 
   the uboone_datatypes files.
3) Run the following (in laradmin/svnToGit/refactor)

   copy_build_files -s <path to final beta release>/uboonecode -t uboonecode
   copy_build_files -s <path to final beta release>/lbnecode -t lbnecode
   
4)  Look for include file directives to change in lbnecode and uboonecode
   grep -ri "#include.*boone" uboonecode | grep -v \.fcl | grep -v uboone_datatypes\/ 
   grep -ril "#include.*boone" uboonecode | grep -v \.fcl | grep -v uboone_datatypes\/
   
   grep -ri "#include.*lbne" lbnecode | grep -v \.fcl 
   grep -ril "#include.*lbne" lbnecode | grep -v \.fcl
   
   Will need to make sure these point to lbne/<Package>/<header.h>
   
   
5) Modify larcore/Geometry/Geometry.h
          larcore/Geometry/Geometry_service.cc
	  
   to use Geometry helper interface class
	 
6) Modify all fcl files that have "Geometry\s*:" strings in them.
   Add experiment helper configurations. (See issue #5037)
   
   # Define configuration macros here:
   #
   larcore/Geometry/geometry.fcl
   -- define standard_geometry_helper :
          { service_provider : StandardGeometryHelper }
   -- Note that this files includes the following two

   larcore/Geometry/geometry_lbne.fcl
   -- define lbne_geometry_helper :
          { service_provider : LBNEGeometryHelper }

   larcore/Geometry/geometry_microboone.flc
   -- define microboone_geometry_helper : 
          { service_provider : StandardGeometryHelper }

   larcore/Geometry/geometry_&lt;expt&gt;.fcl (for all but lbne and microboone)
   -- define <expt>_geometry_helper :
          { service_provider : StandardGeometryHelper }

   # Reference configuration macros in files returned
   # by these commands
   #
   find . -name \*fcl|xargs grep -l "^\s*Geometry\s*:" 
   find . -name \*fcl|xargs grep -l "\.Geometry\s*:" 

7) Run remove_moved_files
   This removes files that were re-factored in step (2) from their
   original locations.   
   (Use remove_moved_files -n to show what it will do without removing
   anything.)
