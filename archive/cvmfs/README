At this time oasis-sync needs to be run as yourself, not as user larsoft.

Before running oasis-sync, you need to initialize your grid credentials.

grid-proxy-init -voms fermilab

This step must be interactive because you need to supply a password.
Somewhere around March 2014 we hope that infrastructure will be in
place so that this can be automated and run by larsoft instead of
individual users.

Once you have completed the init step:

~larsoft/code/laradmin/cvmfs/oasis-sync larsoft

oasis-sync options:
  -n: use the rsync dry-run option (implies -r)
  -v: use the rsync verbose option
  -r: do only rsync step
  -p: do only publish step

The parameter can be larsoft, common, uboone, or lbne, and it can be 
followed by a subdirectory to sync just a specific tool or version,
for example larsoft/mrb or common/prd/jobsub_client/v0_1_3.
