# laradmin

This package archives the scripts and methods we have used for various major changes in the LArSoft packages, such as moving the code from svn to git.

The doxygen scripts are also found here under the nightly subdirectory.

Find the scripts used to migrate the LArSoft wiki pages from redmine to larsoft.github.io in the gitwiki subdirectory.

This package is seldom built and is not distributed.  The usual method is to checkout laradmin and use the scripts directly.
